# RockPaperScissors-Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". It includes a console-based game where players can choose to play against a computer or against a friend. The game keeps track of scores for both players and provides a user-friendly interface for an enjoyable gaming experience. Additionally, it allows players to exit the game gracefully whenever they desire. This project serves as a fun and educational example of basic Java programming and game development concepts.
